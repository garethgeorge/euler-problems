# euler-problems
In this repository I will be publishing my solutions to the euler problems as I progress through them.

I am first solving the problems using C++ i then intend to return and solve them in haskell as I learn it.

Many solutions as you will easily see are not necessarily the optimal solutions but because of the nature of the C++ language and its compiler there is no need for optimization. I may return to problems and optimize them later.
